Steps to Run the test 

 

1:  Download & install node on your system (if you already have node installed on your system skip this step ) 

Software Download link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/  

Steps to install: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows  

 

2: Go to github link to download the code 

Github Link: https://github.com/abhisheksinghrathor/photo-app

 

3: open command prompt on your desktop and go to the path where you have downloaded the code 

Like my code is in https://github.com/abhisheksinghrathor/photo-app

So go to this path in command promt  


4: run node command  “npm install” to install the package require 


5: Now when all the packages are install run “npm start” to run code on server 


Now the code ill run on web server 

“ http://localhost:3000/ “ 
Use "http://<your ipaddrss>:3000/" in case you get CORS issue

About the Code : 

 

The task of this application is to  

• Display all images in a Masonary layout.  

• Show details of an individual image when it is selected.  

• It should contain two routes: o Image Masonary Grid rouet. o Image details route. 

 

I used the technologies like React, Jquery, Html, Scss, ES6 for this application 

I have used react components to design components for each functionality so the application can be more loosely coupled and each component can be used to other places like plug n play. 

 

I have tried to implement this application as per as the given requirements in the documents shared to me but there are some areas where we can improve the application (if i have enough data and time i would try to add some more features)
